Indexing tool usage.

index.py -i <in-dir> -o <out-dir> -c <config-file> -s

	-i <in-dir>:          the input directory, the one to search.
	-o <out-dir>:         the output directory, where your lists/indexes are written
	-c <config-file>:     ini-file describing the searches and output files

	-s:                   sort the results by path/filename

Configuration file format:
	[<outfile>]
	pattern=<searchregex>
	flags=<regex flags>

... where: 
	<outfile>: the name of the file in <out-dir>
	<searchregex>: filename patterns to map to this <outfile>
	<regex flags>: Python constants, e.g. re.IGNORECASE (this is eval()-ed)

The configuration file is handled by Python ConfigParser, so it supports
flexible format strings. For example...

	[somefile.list]
	blob=*.(bin|raw)
	pattern=*somefile*%(blob)s

This would produce a pattern of "*somefile**.(bin|raw)"
