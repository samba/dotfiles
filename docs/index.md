# Dotfiles

Probably you should check out the [README][1] if you care for much detail.

To bootstrap a new machine with this configuration:

```shell
which apt-get && apt-get install git-core make python python2.7 ;
git clone https://github.com/samba/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && make dotfiles
```

**On a Mac** you will need to install XCode first.
